# Financial Document Analyzer — CrewAI Debug Challenge

AI Internship Assignment Submission  
Built using **CrewAI + FastAPI + Celery + Redis + SQLAlchemy**

---

## Project Overview

The **Financial Document Analyzer** is an AI-powered backend system that analyzes uploaded financial PDF documents and generates structured investment insights.

This project fixes a broken CrewAI repository that contained:

- Deterministic bugs
- Dependency conflicts
- Incorrect tool implementations
- Inefficient / hallucinating prompts
- Blocking API execution
- Non-scalable architecture

The system has been fully debugged, optimized, and upgraded into a **production-ready AI backend service**.

## Bugs Found & Fixed

### 1. Broken CrewAI Imports
Updated deprecated imports to new CrewAI API.

### 2. Invalid Tool Implementation
Converted simple functions into proper `BaseTool` classes with `_run()` method.

### 3. Dependency Conflicts
Resolved:
- pydantic conflicts
- click version issues
- onnxruntime mismatches

### 4. Hallucinating / Unsafe Prompts
Rewrote agent prompts to produce:
- Professional financial analysis
- Structured output
- Safe investment recommendations

### 5. Blocking API Execution
Original repo executed AI inside FastAPI directly.

Fixed by:
- Implementing Celery queue worker
- Making analysis asynchronous

### 6. Circular Import Errors
Separated Crew execution logic into `crew_runner.py`.

### 7. File Handling Issues
Added:
- Safe directory creation
- File existence validation
- Cleanup handling

## Installation & Setup

### 1️ Clone Repository

```bash
git clone <your-repo-link>
cd financial-document-analyzer

2️ Create Virtual Environment

5️ Start Redis
redis-server

6️ Start Celery Worker (Windows Compatible)
celery -A worker worker --pool=solo --loglevel=info

7️ Start FastAPI Server
uvicorn main:app --reload

8️ Open Swagger UI
http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs

API Endpoints
Health Check
GET /
Upload & Analyze
POST /analyze

Response:

{
  "status": "processing",
  "task_id": "...",
  "analysis_id": 11
}
Get Task Result
GET /result/{task_id}
Get Analysis History
GET /history
Get Single Analysis
GET /analysis/{analysis_id}

Concurrency Model

FastAPI handles incoming requests

Celery queues tasks

Redis distributes tasks

Workers process in background

Database stores results

Multiple financial documents can be processed without blocking the API.

🗄 Database Schema
Analysis Table
Field	Description
id	Analysis ID
filename	Uploaded file name
query	User query
status	processing / completed / failed
result	AI output
created_at	Start timestamp
completed_at	Completion timestamp

Testing Concurrency

Upload multiple PDFs quickly:

POST /analyze
POST /analyze
POST /analyze

Celery processes them asynchronously.
